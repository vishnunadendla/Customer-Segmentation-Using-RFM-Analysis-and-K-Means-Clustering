# **Online Retail Data Analysis: RFM Segmentation and Clustering**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing an online retail dataset using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** to segment customers and perform clustering. The goal is to identify meaningful customer segments based on their purchasing behavior and to uncover insights that can guide business strategy.

The dataset was sourced from [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Data-mining-for-the-online-retail-industry%3A-A-case-Chen-Sain/e43a5a90fa33d419df42e485099f8f08badf2149). I performed a series of data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and outliers, applying the RFM analysis, and using Power Transformation to correct skewness in the data. Finally, I performed clustering using k-means and visualized the results.

## **Steps Involved**

### **1. Data Acquisition**
I began by searching for an online dataset that would be suitable for both learning and representation. The dataset I chose from [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Data-mining-for-the-online-retail-industry%3A-A-case-Chen-Sain/e43a5a90fa33d419df42e485099f8f08badf2149) contains transaction details of customers from an online retail industry.

### **2. Data Cleaning**
After importing the dataset, I started analyzing it. The data contained negative values in certain columns, which were incorrect in the context of sales and customer behavior. I removed these negative values using basic functions. Additionally, there were missing values in the **Customer ID** column, which I handled by removing rows where Customer ID was null, as it was crucial for the analysis.

### **3. RFM Analysis**
RFM analysis helps in segmenting customers based on three metrics:
- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
- **Frequency**: How often the customer makes a purchase.
- **Monetary**: How much the customer spends.

Using the `qcut()` function, I divided the data into four categories (quintiles) based on each of the RFM metrics. This provided a clear segmentation of customers based on their behavior.

### **4. Handling Skewness and Outliers**
During the analysis, I observed a significant amount of skewness in the data, leading to the presence of outliers. Rather than removing these outliers, I chose to retain them as they provide valuable insights into customer behavior. To address the skewness, I applied a **Power Transformer**, which transformed the data into a more normal distribution. While a log transformation could also have been used, I opted for the Power Transformer for a different approach.

### **5. Clustering Using k-means**
For the clustering process, I used the **k-means** algorithm to group customers based on their RFM values. To determine the ideal number of clusters, I applied the **elbow method**. The elbow plot suggested that the optimal number of clusters could be 2, but I chose to proceed with 3 clusters, as I believed it would provide more meaningful and interpretable insights.

## **Key Insights**
- **Cluster 1**: Customers with low frequency, recency, and monetary value. This group represents customers who have not made recent purchases and are unlikely to generate future revenue without targeted interventions.
- **Cluster 2**: Customers with moderate recency, frequency, and monetary value. These customers are still engaged with the brand and could be targeted for loyalty programs or promotions.
- **Cluster 3**: High-value customers with frequent and recent purchases. These customers are the most profitable and should be prioritized for retention and personalized offers.

## **Tools and Libraries Used**
- **Python**: For data analysis and modeling
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
  - `numpy`: Numerical operations
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Data visualization
  - `sklearn`: Machine learning (Power Transformer, k-means, t-SNE)
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For writing and executing the code

## **Conclusion**
This project highlights how RFM analysis and clustering can be applied to customer data for segmentation. By understanding customer behavior, businesses can create targeted marketing strategies and improve customer retention. Additionally, the application of data transformation techniques like Power Transformer enhances the quality of analysis by addressing issues like skewness.
